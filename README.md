## Getting Started

 - clone it
 - `bundle` it 
 - `foreman start` it
 - `rake db:mongoid:create_indexes` it
 - bop it!

## Testing

`rake` will do everything, and it's probably a good idea to run `guard` so you can have `rubocop` yell at you for violating [some style guide](https://xkcd.com/1513/).
